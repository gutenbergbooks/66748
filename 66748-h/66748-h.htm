</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who profess to know all about slavery
will tell you that the negro was a thousand times
happier as a slave than he is as a freeman. This
may be true of some of the race; we do not
enter into the question. The field-hand was
in general an entirely irresponsible creature.
He belonged to his master as thoroughly as the
dogs and horses did, and he was of infinitely
less importance. He had his daily task and his
daily rations; he had also, if owned by a kind
master, his little amusements, chief of which
were the dance and the camp-meeting. Such a
life would naturally not inspire one with any
very high ambition. Give the plantation negro
his hoe-cake and his bit of fat pork, his banjo,
and the privilege of telling his experience to an
unlimited chorus of ‘Halleluiahs!’ and ‘Bress
de Lords!’ and you gave him perfect bliss. If
the white man was his oppressor, he seldom
knew it. ‘De family’ were, except in rare cases,
admired and revered. And these poor creatures
who did not own themselves, assumed and felt
an air of proud proprietorship when speaking of
the glories of their master’s state, and specially
of each ‘young mas’r’ and ‘lily miss.’ ‘Young
mas’r’ was at once their tyrant and their darling.
I have heard a wedding ceremony wound up with,
‘Hark, from de tombs a doleful sound!’ with
all its concomitant tears and groans, because
‘Marse Harry’ had so ordered.</p>

<p>This state of things by no means came to an
end with the civil war. Long after the slaves
were freemen, and the broad acres had changed
owners, and ‘old mas’r’ had fallen in battle or
died broken-hearted, all that were left of the
proud old name were still ‘de family’ to those
loving hearts. While the writer lived in one of
the border towns of Virginia, the mother of one
of her maids appeared one day to ask for largess.
‘We’se done goin’ to hab a party, Miss Anne,’
said she; ‘an’ some ob de ladies dey gibs me
flour; an’ some, eggs; an’ some, sugar; an’ ole
missis she would a’ gib me a whole great big
cake, but I up an’ tole her I had one.&mdash;It was
a lie,’ she explained earnestly, fearing I would
think further gifts unnecessary; ‘but some o’
dem pore white trash say de missis hain’t got
nuff to eat.’ And Chloe fairly sobbed.</p>

<p>I ventured to ask the occasion of the festivity.</p>

<p>‘Well, ye see, Miss Anne,’ said Chloe, brightening,
‘us cullud pussons is gettin’ married now
just like white folks; an’ as my ole mammy
’ll be eighty the day after to-morrow, Marse
George said I had oughter gib her an’ father a
weddin’.’</p>

<p>Better late than never, thought I, as I added
something to Chloe’s basket.</p>

<p>In addition to the plantation negroes and the
often petted and spoiled household servants,
there was among the coloured population of the
South a certain proportion of skilled mechanics.
These were not only, from their superior intelligence,
more alive than the rest of their race to
the hardship of slavery, but, from their greater
value, more apt to suffer from it. Why, for
instance, should Jim, a good blacksmith, trifle
his time away on the plantation, where there
was little or nothing for him to do, when Smith
in the adjacent town will give Jim’s master,
always in need of money, handsome payment
for the slave’s services? The master is perhaps
a kind man, and Smith known to be just the
reverse, but hiring is not like selling. And so
Jim goes, and toils in the sweat of his brow
till Smith’s payment to the master is wrung out
from him a thousandfold.</p>

<p>It is of one of these mechanics I am going to
tell you, and, excepting that the names of the
persons connected with the story have been
changed, every word of Abe’s story is true.</p>

<p>In the heart of West Virginia, on the picturesque
banks of the Great Kanawha River,
there is a large tract of land once owned by
Washington. Besides the niece who afterwards
became Mrs Parke Custis, Washington had
another in whom he was greatly interested, the
daughter of his brother Lawrence. This lady,
much against the wishes of her distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_818">{818}</span>
uncle, became the wife of Major Parks of Baltimore;
and when this gallant officer, fulfilling
Washington’s predictions, had spent all he could
lay his hands upon and a great deal more, the
couple, for his sins, were banished to what was
then the wilderness of Western Virginia. Their
daughter in course of time married Mr Prescott,
a rich young planter from the east, whose money,
laid out on the Washington acres, produced a
flourishing plantation; while on one of the most
romantic sites on the Kanawha arose a noble
mansion known as Prescott Place. Here Mrs
Prescott exercised for years a lavish hospitality;
and here were preserved, until fire consumed
them and the mansion together, sundry relics of
Washington, chief of which was a characteristic
letter to his niece, written before her marriage,
warning her that as she made her bed, so she
should lie upon it.</p>

<p>When young Laura Prescott married gay Dick
Randolph, Abe, the son of Mr Prescott’s body-servant,
was one of numerous presents of like
kind. Abe was an excellent carpenter; and when
dark days came to the Prescotts and Randolphs,
it was Abe himself who persuaded ‘Marse Dick’
to sell him to a man from the north named
Hartley, who from being a slave-driver had risen
to be a slave-owner, and who had the reputation
of being a very demon. Again and again Hartley
offered a tempting price, and again and again Dick
Randolph refused it; nor would he have yielded
at last, hard pressed as he was, had he not felt
that Abe, being about to be hired to a builder
in the neighbourhood, would be really out of
Hartley’s power. And when, some months after
the sale, Abe walked over to Prescott Place to tell
that his new master was going to allow him
to purchase his freedom by working over-hours,
Mr Randolph felt quite at ease about the faithful
fellow. A price being set by Hartley, Abe set
himself cheerfully to earn it&mdash;for years commencing
his day’s work with the dawn, and
carrying it far into the night.</p>

<p>But the general opinion of Hartley had not,
it was soon seen, done him injustice. Twice,
thrice, was the price of Abe’s freedom raised just
as he seemed on the eve of gaining it; and after
the third disappointment, the slave became utterly
hopeless, and, abandoning all extra labour, spent
his spare hours in the darkest corner of his
wretched cabin, brooding over his wrongs. This
was by no means what Hartley intended; so,
to encourage Abe, he was led to promise, in the
presence of Mr Randolph, that he would abide by
the sum last named. In law, of course, the promise
was good for nothing; but the <i>ci-devant</i>
slave-driver was supposed to have some regard
for public opinion. In vain Mr Randolph offered
a higher price than was demanded for the slave
himself. Abe should buy himself, Hartley said,
or he should not be bought at all.</p>

<p>Three years had passed, when Abe, getting a
half-holiday from the builder who hired him, set
off for Hartley’s with the stipulated sum. On
his way there he stopped at Prescott Place to tell
the good news. This was just at the beginning
of the war; and Mr Randolph, being about to
join the army, had promised to take Abe with
him as his servant.</p>

<p>Next morning, while breakfast was being
served at Prescott Place, a loud scuffle was heard
at the dining-room door, and Hartley, using his
whip freely on the servant who tried to stop
him, strode into the room livid with passion,
and flourishing his whip in Mr Randolph’s face,
yelled, with an oath: ‘Where is that nigger?’</p>

<p>Dick Randolph’s blood was up in a moment,
but he was first of all a gentleman. ‘Do you
see my wife?’ he asked sternly.</p>

<p>A coarse response from Hartley was all the
reply, and in a moment the ruffian had measured
his length on the floor; nor did he remember
more till he found himself struggling in a pool
of not very clean water by the highway. The
negroes had received orders to take him off the
plantation, and the precise spot where they were
to deposit him not having been mentioned, they
had selected one in accordance with his deserts.</p>

<p>Hartley thought it prudent to disappear for
a time. Whether he was simply a coward, or
feared that some ugly facts connected with the
case might leak out, was never known. Abe
himself was not seen or heard of; and his story,
except by a few, was soon, in these eventful
times, forgotten.</p>

<p>But the facts of the case were these: on the
evening referred to, Abe had found his master
pleasant, and even jocular, wishing he had not
given the promise, offering to buy Abe back
again, and so on. At last he turned to business.
The money was produced and counted.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said Hartley, inquiringly.</p>

<p>Abe did not understand. Hartley seemed waiting
for something. At last he spoke plainly.
‘Where is the rest of the money?’</p>

<p>The scoundrel had made up his mind to deny
having received the previous payments, to deny
all knowledge even of sums he had meanly
borrowed from his slave, and to hand him back
to helpless, hopeless slavery.</p>

<p>That night Abe appeared at the cabin of his
wife, a slave on a distant plantation. There he
briefly told the story of his wrongs, adding:
‘I am going to-night. It may be long before
you see me; but if it is fifty years, I will
come back for you, if you are faithful.’</p>

<p>Phyllis promised to be true; and kept her
promise as slaves do; that is, she married&mdash;they
called it marrying&mdash;the first man who asked
her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The five years of the war had come and gone,
and ten years more. Major Randolph, past
middle age, and utterly ruined, was trying, in
a small Virginian town, to take up the profession
of law, which, in happier days, he had studied,
but had not cared to practise; and the widow
of Hartley, who had meantime died bankrupt,
was keeping a boarding-house in the same
place; when, on a certain forenoon, there was
shown into the Randolphs’ parlour a tall, portly,
middle-aged man, gentlemanly in appearance, and
thoroughly well dressed, but perfectly black. The
Irish maid-of-all-work had forgiven his colour for
the sake of his clothes.</p>

<p>Mr Randolph happened to be at home, and it
was to him the stranger eagerly turned. ‘Marse
Dick!’ he cried.</p>

<p>‘Abe!’</p>

<p>And Abe it was. And there were tears in at
least three pairs of eyes as the master and slave
of former days shook hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_819">{819}</span></p>

<p>Well, Abe might have been a long-lost brother,
Major Randolph was so glad to see him. He
made him tell his adventures from the time he
left Hartley until he appeared in the Randolphs’
parlour; he showed him his sons and his
daughters, and rattled on about old days. But
never a word did he say about wounds and losses
and disappointments; though it could hardly
have escaped Abe’s affectionate eyes that, while
his own outer man bore such marks of prosperity,
his old master’s had grown actually shabby.</p>

<p>By ways and means generally forthcoming to
border negroes who had the courage and prudence
to avail themselves of them, Abe had gone northward
first, returning to Virginia, however, the
moment the emancipation proclamation was issued.
Hearing of Major Randolph’s absence and his
own wife’s unfaithfulness, he had wandered
farther and farther from his old home, and had
settled at last in a far south-western state. There
he had worked steadily; at first on shares, then
for himself; till at the time of his visit to
Virginia, he was the manager and largest shareholder
of the celebrated Hot Springs of A&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Need I say how earnestly ‘Marse Dick’ was
besought to try the springs for his rheumatism,
to bring ‘Miss Laura’ and the family, to enjoy
horses and carriages, to fish and hunt, and generally
to enter into possession?</p>

<p>Old Mrs Prescott, who still lived, shared with
her son and daughter the pleasure of Abe’s return,
and the young Randolphs listened with delight
to such an interesting romance. And yet&mdash;truth
compels me to confess that the eldest daughter
gave more than one uneasy glance into the street,
and was literally sitting on thorns. What if
a morning caller should find a negro in the
Randolph parlour? Even kind Mrs Randolph
had a feeling of uneasiness as the early dinner-hour
approached. But the master guessed at
no such embarrassments. The hour came; the
bell rang, and as easily and cordially Major
Randolph said: ‘You will come to dinner with
us, Abe.’</p>

<p>‘After you and the family, Marse Dick.’</p>

<p>‘<i>With</i> me and the family,’ replied Major
Randolph.</p>

<p>And though Abe earnestly begged to be allowed
to wait, into the dining-room he went. And I
may add, that had the most curious or mischievous
eyes been on the watch for solecisms of any kind,
they would have been disappointed.</p>

<p>‘What would you have had me do?’ said
Major Randolph afterwards. ‘There was Abe,
dying to lavish on his old master all he possessed.
Was I to be outdone in hospitality by
my own old slave?’</p>

<p>‘And Abe had just as much delicacy as papa,’
owned Miss Randolph, who felt she could afford
to praise when the critical period was safely over&mdash;a
merciful providence having kept away visitors.
‘He spoke just as good English as we do. But
did you notice that, though he spoke of Mr
Hartley and Mr everybody else, he always called
papa “Marse Dick?”’</p>

<p>Before Abe left town, he had put a little bit
of business in Mr Randolph’s hands&mdash;no other
than the settlement of a mortgage that threatened
to ruin Mrs Hartley and her children. ‘O Marse
Dick!’ he said, ‘I have been keeping away till
I was rich enough to buy that man up; and then
I meant to meet him face to face and ask him
what he thought of himself. I doubt if I could
have kept my hands off him; and now he is gone.
I hope the good Lord will forgive me!’</p>

<p>Were I writing a romance, I might tell how
Abe made his old master’s fortune. But I have
given you a poor idea of Major Randolph if I
have led you to imagine he would allow himself
to profit by his old servant’s prosperity in the
smallest degree. If Abe told him of a good investment,
he had no money. If a loan was modestly
and hesitatingly offered, on the plea that Abe
wished to place money at interest, and that there
were so few whom he could trust, it was kindly
but decidedly refused. And so Abe grows richer,
and Major Randolph poorer than ever. The old-time
slaves, with many misty ideas on the subject
of religion, had one article of belief which they
understood clearly, and for which they would
have suffered martyrdom&mdash;namely, that in the
next world it would be their turn to sit at
table and eat the good things, while the proud
white folks should ‘grease de griddle and turn
de cakes.’ The doctrine is founded on the principle
of compensation, but the compensation in
some cases begins here.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">I have</span> something of serious import to say to
you,’ were Mora’s first words as he went forward
a few steps and then halted. ‘Hector Laroche, do
you know that you are in imminent danger of
your life?’</p>

<p>He gave a little start and looked at her fixedly
for a moment or two. ‘No; I am not aware of
anything of the kind,’ he answered with a sneer.
‘Madame, you are oracular!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, hush! This is no time for levity. Will
you not believe me when I tell you that your
life is in danger? The assassins have tracked
you&mdash;they have followed you here&mdash;they have
sworn to take your life!’</p>

<p>‘The assassins! What assassins?’ he shrieked
as he bounded to his feet.</p>

<p>‘Can you not guess? Think, Laroche, think!
Oh, how like you it was to turn traitor to the
cause to which you had bound yourself by oath,
and to betray your comrades! But your treachery
has been discovered. The penalty you cannot be
ignorant of.’</p>

<p>He had turned livid with terror while Mora was
speaking. A glassy film had overspread his eyes,
which looked dilated to twice their ordinary size.
His gaze wandered from corner to corner of the
room with a sort of stealthy fright, as if dreading
that an assassin might spring upon him at any
moment. A cold perspiration bathed him from
head to foot; he trembled in every limb, and
would have fallen had he not supported himself
with his back and hands against the bureau.</p>

<p>‘How am I to know that what you have just
told me has any truth in it?’ he asked at length,
with a strange hoarseness in his voice. ‘What
should you, Mora De Vigne, know of secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_820">{820}</span>
societies, plots, and conspiracies? Who should
speak to you of these things, the secrets of which
are known to the initiated alone? No; it is a
lie&mdash;a lie! Some wretched fool has imposed
upon you, or else you have concocted this story
yourself in order to frighten me away.’</p>

<p>Looking straight at him, Mora said slowly:
‘<i>The right hand of the Czar is frozen.</i>’</p>

<p>A low cry burst from the wretched man’s lips;
he buried his face in his hands and fell on his
knees; he knew that his doom was sealed.</p>

<p>A pang of compassion shot through Mora’s
heart. She made a step or two forward and
then drew back with a shudder. All her
womanly instincts revolted against the man.
Not even at that supreme moment could she
bring herself to go near him. ‘You must go
away at once&mdash;to-night,’ she said. ‘To-morrow
may be too late.’ She found herself repeating
the very words of Jules.</p>

<p>‘Go away&mdash;where?’ he asked with a groan,
turning his haggard face full upon her. ‘All
places are alike. There is no escape&mdash;none!’ He
rose to his feet and staggered across the room to
the ottoman, on which he sank, and buried his
face in the cushions.</p>

<p>‘Will you allow me to send for Colonel Woodruffe?
He will be able to counsel you far better
than I as to what had best be done for your
safety.’</p>

<p>As Laroche neither assented nor dissented,
Nanette was at once despatched in quest of the
colonel, who was still with Sir William. He
followed close on Nanette’s heels. A few words
aside from Mora put him in possession of the
facts of the case.</p>

<p>‘Laroche, this is a bad business&mdash;a very bad
business,’ he said as he crossed to the ottoman
and laid a hand on the Frenchman’s shoulder.
‘But sit up, and let us look the situation in the
face. Whining is of no use&mdash;never is. We have
to act. While there’s life there’s hope, and I
for one don’t despair of dragging you out of this
dilemma, however awkward it may look just
now.’</p>

<p>‘No, monsieur; there is no hope&mdash;none,’
cried Laroche. ‘They have tracked me here&mdash;they
will track me everywhere, till one day their
opportunity will arrive. I know&mdash;I know!’ His
nervous agitation was still so extreme that the
words seemed as if they could scarcely form
themselves on his lips.</p>

<p>‘Here&mdash;drink this,’ said the colonel, handing
him a glass containing brandy, which Mora had
brought at his request.</p>

<p>Laroche swallowed the spirit greedily. It
helped to steady his nerves for the time being, if
it did him no other good.</p>

<p>‘What Madame De Vigne says is quite true,’
resumed the colonel. ‘You must get away from
this place without an hour’s delay. I have
thought of a plan which will at least insure your
safety for a little while to come; after that, you
will have to shift for yourself. I knew this part
of the country well when a boy. There is a
farmhouse kept by an old acquaintance of mine
in a lonely valley about two miles from the
opposite shore of the lake. I will take you there
to-night, and you can stay there till you have
decided what your future plans shall be.’</p>

<p>‘O monsieur, you are too good! I have not
deserved this,’ cried the abject wretch.</p>

<p>‘You speak the truth, Laroche; you have not
deserved it,’ answered the other gravely. ‘How
soon can you be ready to start?’</p>

<p>‘In ten minutes, monsieur.’</p>

<p>‘Good.’</p>

<p>‘But I shall need money, monsieur.’</p>

<p>‘It shall be found you. Have you any idea
as to what your plans will be after you leave the
farmhouse?’</p>

<p>‘I shall endeavour to make my way to London&mdash;it
is the best hiding-place in the world for those
who know it. There I shall lie quiet for a
little while. After that’&mdash;&mdash; He ended with an
expressive lifting of his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘If you will get ready, then,’ said the colonel.
‘I too have a few arrangements to make.’</p>

<p>Laroche nodded; then he went to the door,
opened it, and gazed furtively up and down the
corridor. Not a creature was in sight. He darted
away and sped up the thickly carpeted staircase
as noiselessly as a shadow.</p>

<p>The colonel sent Nanette in search of Archie
Ridsdale. He came at once, and as soon as the
situation of affairs had been partially explained
to him, he was despatched with a message to
the boathouse. Then the colonel in his turn
left the room. He was only absent three or four
minutes, and when he came back he was carrying
a small roll of notes in his hand.</p>

<p>Mora had subsided into an easy-chair from the
moment Colonel Woodruffe had taken charge of
the situation, and there she was still sitting.
Who could have analysed her thoughts during
the last painful quarter of an hour, or have
adequately described the varied phases of emotion
which ebbed and flowed through her heart!</p>

<p>Immediately following on the return of the
colonel, came Archie Ridsdale. Each of them
was muffled in his ulster, for although the storm
had not yet broken over the valley, it might
do so at any moment.</p>

<p>A minute later the door opened and Laroche
stole in. For a moment or two none of them
recognised him. His black beard and moustache
had vanished; a grizzled wig with long lanky
tufts of hair, which fell on his coat-collar behind,
covered his head; his eyebrows had been manipulated
to match the wig; while a pair of heavy
horn-rimmed spectacles served to disguise him
still further. There was no longer the slightest
trace of a Parisian dandy in his appearance; his
clothes were homely, and of the fashion of some
years previously. He looked like a small provincial
shopkeeper who might have come over to
England for a holiday. But no disguise could
hide the pallor of his face, the nervous twitching
of his thin lips, or the abject terror that lurked
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Archie and the colonel stood up. The moment
of departure had come. Laroche turned to his
wife, who had also risen. Placing both his hands
over his heart and bending low in front of her,
he said in a husky whisper: ‘Mora, pardon,
pardon! We shall never meet again.’</p>

<p>For a moment or two she hesitated; all the
woman within her was profoundly moved; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_821">{821}</span>
she went up to him. ‘Hector, with my whole
heart I forgive you!’ she said.</p>

<p>That was their farewell. A moment later Mora
heard the door close behind the three men.</p>

<p>She turned down the lamp and drew back one
of the curtains. It was pitch-dark outside; not
a star was visible. She opened the window a
little way, in order that she might watch as well
as listen. Presently she heard a faint noise of
footsteps on the gravel below. The three men
had left the hotel by way of the French-window
in the sitting-room on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Mora stood with straining eyes and ears. Suddenly
the darkness was shivered by a quivering
flash of lightning, and in that instant she saw
the figures of the three men crossing the slope
of the hill on their way to the lake. At the
same time, she imagined she saw the stealthy
form of Santelle disappear behind a clump of
laurel, as if he were watching the retreating
figures.&mdash;Will he have known Laroche in spite
of his disguise?</p>

<p>The thought sent a cold tremor through her
heart&mdash;half of horror, half of regret. But darkness
had come again in the twinkling of an eye,
and she saw nothing more. With a heavy sigh,
she let the curtain drop into its place just as the
door opened and Clarice entered the room.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Three weeks had passed since the flight of
Hector Laroche, when one wet forenoon Colonel
Woodruffe, in company with a constable in plain
clothes, found himself at the door of a low
lodging-house in a frowsy-looking street in close
proximity to one of the docks. The landlord of
the house admitted the visitors, and ushering
them up-stairs, unlocked the door of a small
bedroom. There, on a ragged straw mattress,
lay the dead body of Hector Laroche. A paragraph
in the morning’s paper had aroused the
suspicions of Colonel Woodruffe, who happened
to be in London at the time, and he at once
ordered a cab and set his face eastward.</p>

<p>The statement of the landlord of the lodging-house
was to the effect that Laroche had lodged
with him for little more than a week at the
time of his death; that he was exceedingly quiet
and well behaved; that he lay in bed nearly
the whole day, reading the newspapers and
French novels, and having a bottle of brandy at
his elbow; and that he rarely went out of doors
till after nightfall, and then only for a short time.
On the Tuesday, contrary to his custom, he had
gone out about noon, and on returning a little
before dusk, had remarked to the landlord that
he should only require his bed for one night
more, as he had just secured a berth on board
a steamer which was to sail the following day.
At that time, he appeared to be somewhat the
worse for drink. He went up-stairs soon afterwards,
and nothing more was seen or heard of
him. As he was in the habit of not rising till
late, no comment was made on his non-appearance
next morning; and it was not till two o’clock
in the afternoon that the landlord knocked at
his door. There being no reply to his summons,
he opened the door and went in. There he found
Laroche, lying on his bed as if asleep, and dressed,
except for his coat and waistcoat. But over his
face was spread a fine cambric handkerchief, which
medical evidence afterwards proved to have been
saturated with chloroform. On the table by his
side were a novel, a half-emptied bottle of cognac,
a phial, uncorked, containing chloroform, and the
dead man’s watch and chain. In one of his
pockets was found a purse containing a considerable
sum in notes and gold.</p>

<p>At the inquest, the tendency of the evidence
pointed strongly to the probability of the deceased
having committed suicide while under the temporary
influence of strong drink. There was only
one piece of evidence forthcoming which served
in some measure to invalidate that assumption.
The landlord of the house deposed to the fact
of the lock of the bedroom door having been
secretly tampered with, so that while the door
was to all appearance fastened on the inside,
it could be opened without difficulty from without.
As, however, there was no evidence forthcoming
to implicate any one in particular with
the act in question, and as the property of the
dead man had apparently not been touched, the
jury had no option but to bring in an open
verdict. The evidence tendered by Colonel
Woodruffe was confined entirely to the question
of identity.</p>

<p>Two days later he attended Laroche’s funeral&mdash;the
solitary ‘mourner’ there. This he did out
of respect for Mora.</p>

<p>Whether Laroche’s death was the result of his
own rash act, or whether it was due to certain
other agencies of which mention has previously
been made, is one of those mysteries respecting
which the world will probably never be any
wiser than it is now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lady Renshaw was as good as her word when
she stated that she had discarded her niece for
ever. But it is possible that she might not have
proved quite so obdurate had she not at the
same time found herself so thoroughly checkmated
in other directions. Her surprise at finding Mr
Etheridge transformed into Sir William Ridsdale,
and the knowledge that all her scheming to secure
the rich baronet’s son for Miss Wynter had not
only proved futile, but had evidently been seen
through from the first by the keen-eyed Sir
William, combined with her chagrin that Madame
De Vigne, instead of being regarded in the light
of an adventuress, was looked upon as a person
whose friendship any one might feel proud to
claim, following so close upon Bella’s ‘heartless
duplicity,’ proved more than she had the courage
to face. And when, in addition, a horrid suspicion
began to shape itself in her mind that
Dr M‘Murdo&mdash;no doubt instigated thereto by
that odious Miss Gaisford&mdash;instead of having
fallen in love with her, as she so fondly dreamed,
had been merely trying to make her look ridiculous,
and amuse himself at the same time&mdash;it
was no wonder she made up her mind that the
sooner she left the <i>Palatine</i> and its inmates behind
her the better.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out next morning that when Bella,
intent on forgiveness and reconciliation, knocked
at her aunt’s door, there came no response; after
which a very brief inquiry sufficed to establish
the fact that Lady Renshaw had risen at some
abnormally early hour, and, accompanied by her
maid, had started southward by the first train.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_822">{822}</span>
She had left behind her no word or message
of any kind for the dismayed girl, who found
herself thus cruelly deserted in the huge hotel.</p>

<p>But Miss Pen came to the rescue almost before
Bella in her bewilderment had time fully to
realise the fact of her aunt’s desertion. The little
circle of which Miss Pen formed a component
part welcomed her as one of themselves, now
that the incubus of Lady Renshaw’s presence was
removed; and Bella quickly found that what she
had lost in one direction was far more than
made up to her in others. When, two days later,
the party at the <i>Palatine</i> broke up, Miss Wynter
accompanied the Rev. Septimus and his sister
to their home in the Midlands, there to remain
till Mr Dulcimer was prepared to claim her as
his wife. And there, some three months later,
a quiet wedding took place, our good vicar tying
the knot, Sir William himself giving away the
bride, who had not failed to become a great
favourite with him, Archie acting as best-man,
and Miss Loraine as bridesmaid-in-chief. Miss
Pen played a voluntary on the organ, and there
was a mist of tears in her eyes as she did so.
Some vague dream of the past, never to be realised
in this world, may perchance have been busy in
her mind at the time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When spring came round again, the worthy
vicar was called upon to tie two more nuptial
knots. Mora and her sister were married
on the same day. Archie and his wife went
abroad for a year’s travel; and now that they are
back, Clarice, who has far greater faith in her
husband’s abilities than he has himself, has made
up her mind that Archie must go into parliament.
She firmly believes that if he will only do so,
there is a brilliant future before him. Time
will prove.</p>

<p>Sir William has ventured to spend the last
two winters in England, and, somewhat to his
surprise, has found himself none the worse in
health for doing so. He divides his time pretty
equally between his son’s house and that of
Colonel Woodruffe. He did not forget our friend
Mr Dulcimer when an opportunity presented
itself. Through his influence, Dick was appointed
to the secretaryship of a large public Company,
the salary of which just doubled his previous
income. Meanwhile, his wife had not found
existence even in a small suburban villa by any
means so unendurable as she at one time professed
to fear it would be. In truth, her high
spirits and good temper are enough to brighten
any home. She has all the appearance of being
one of the happiest women in England.</p>

<p>Lastly, what is there left to record of her who
has been the central figure of our little history?
Happily, not much. Are not the happiest lives
those of which there is nothing to relate? With
Mora the days of storm and stress are over;
the past with all its wretchedness and misery
seems little more than a hideous dream. She is
happy in the present, and, so far as human
fallibility can judge, there seems every prospect
of her continuing so in time to come. Dr Mac
came all the way from Aberdeen to attend her
marriage. As he shook hands with her after
the ceremony, he said: ‘What a pity, my dear
madame, what a great pity it is that Providence
did not bless you with a twin-sister!’</p>

<p>‘Why so, doctor?’</p>

<p>‘Because, in that case, there is just a possibility
that another poor mortal in addition to my
friend the colonel might have been made a happy
man to-day.’</p>

<p class="ph3">HONESTY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is to be hoped that the animal scale of
morality is not so low that when a brute acts
honestly it does so only because honesty is the
best policy. There are many instances known
of animals acting honestly, when the slightest
promptings of instinct would have shown that
it was more politic to act otherwise. Self-denial
and self-sacrifice have been frequently
needed of animals, and in the hour of temptation
they have not succumbed. Neither fear,
nor pain, nor the cravings of hunger have sufficed
to deter many noble members of the
brute world from their sense of duty. Quite
recently the Canadian papers reported an anecdote
of canine fidelity which, had it been told
of a Roman soldier or a Hindu nurse, would
have been bruited throughout the civilised world
as an instance of humanity’s supremest devotion
to duty. The story as told to us is, that when
nearing Montreal, the engine-driver of a train
saw a great dog standing on the track and
barking furiously. The driver blew his whistle;
yet the hound did not budge, but crouching low,
was struck by the locomotive and killed. Some
pieces of white muslin on the engine attracted
the driver’s notice; he stopped the train and
went back. Beside the dead dog was a dead
child which, it is supposed, had wandered on to
the track and had gone to sleep. The poor
watchful guardian had given its signal for the
train to stop; but unheeded, had died at its post,
a victim to duty.</p>

<p>This is no solitary specimen of canine integrity.
The author of <i>Salad for the Social</i> tells
of a dog whose master deposited a bag in one of
the narrow streets of Southampton, and left his
dog to guard it, with strict injunctions not to
leave it. The faithful creature was so staunch
in the fulfilment of duty, that rather than forsake
its trust, it actually allowed a heavy cart to
drive over it and crush it to death.</p>

<p>It is not merely momentary impulse, nor
ignorance of the effects of this steadfastness&mdash;as
some may imagine&mdash;that prompts animals to
act thus faithfully; there are numerous cases on
record to prove that they will sustain hunger,
endure pain and fatigue, and withstand temptation,
at the dictates of duty, as gallantly as
any human being. Youatt is the authority for
the following remarkable instance of canine integrity.
An officer returning from a day’s shooting
deposited his spoil in a certain room, in the
custody of his dogs. Mechanically he locked the
door, put the key in his pocket, and departed.
Soon afterwards, he was called away upon urgent
business, and during his absence of several
days, forgot all about his game and the dogs.
When he returned home, he hastened to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_823">{823}</span>
room, and there found both dogs dead of
hunger. Not only had they refrained from
touching the game, but they had also kept
quiet, having neither barked nor cried, evidently
fearing to betray the trust they deemed their
master had confided to them.</p>

<p>It is related by Professor Bell that when a
friend of his was travelling abroad, he one morning
took out his purse to see if it contained sufficient
change for a day’s jaunt he proposed making.
He departed from his lodgings, leaving a trusted
dog behind. When he dined, he took out his
purse to pay, and found that he had lost a gold
coin from it. On returning home in the evening,
his servant informed him that the dog seemed
to be very ill, as they could not induce it to
eat anything. He went at once to look at his
favourite; and as soon as he entered the room,
the faithful creature ran to him, deposited the
missing gold coin at his feet, and then devoured
the food placed for it with great eagerness. The
truth was that this gentleman had dropped the
coin in the morning; the dog had picked it up,
and kept it in its mouth, fearing even to eat, lest
it should lose its master’s property before an
opportunity offered to restore it.</p>

<p>Professor Bell also tells of a Newfoundland dog
kept at an inn in Dorset, which was accustomed,
every morning as the clock struck eight, to take
in its mouth a basket placed for the purpose and
containing some pence, and go with it to the
baker’s. The man took out the money, replacing
it by a certain number of rolls, which Neptune
returned home with. He never touched the
eatables; but on one occasion when another dog
attempted to despoil the basket, master Nep put
down his burden and gave the intruder a thrashing;
that accomplished, he regained his charge,
and carried it home in triumph.</p>

<p>In his interesting African Travels, Le Vaillant
details how he missed his favourite setter. After
a fruitless search, and the repeated firing of his
gun to guide the animal, he sent an attendant
back by the way they had travelled to try and
discover the lost favourite. About two leagues
back on the route the dog was found keeping
guard over a chair and basket which had been
dropped unperceived from the wagon. But for
this fortunate discovery of the honest dog, it must
speedily have perished by hunger or from the
beasts of prey.</p>

<p>In Taylor’s <i>General Character of the Dog</i> is
given an account of one of these faithful animals
which daily carried to a labourer in Portsmouth
dockyard his dinner. Trusty, as the dog was
rightly named, had to take the basket containing
his master’s mid-day meal upwards of a mile,
so that he had frequently to rest on the journey.
He was very careful as to where he deposited
his load, and would not allow any one to come
near it. When he reached the dock-gates, he often
had to wait until they were opened for the
admission or egress of any one; but the instant
he could effect an entrance, he ran in with
his charge and carried it to his master, who, after
he had partaken of his dinner, re-delivered the
empty basket to his faithful servitor to carry
home again.</p>

<p>In his <i>Essay on Instinct</i>, Hancock tells of a dog
belonging to a Glasgow taproom keeper that was
accustomed to carry its master’s breakfast to him
in a tin can between its teeth. When the family
removed, the dog changed his route, and never
went wrong. It could not be induced to accept
a favour when on its master’s errands, and
carefully avoided any of its own species. This
incorruptible servant, which by the way understood
Gaelic as well as English, often carried
home meat to the weight of half a stone, but
never attempted to touch it. Dogs, indeed,
rarely attempt to touch food belonging to
their owners. One very remarkable instance is
recorded by Jesse of a dog that accompanied
its mistress when returning from market with a
basket of provisions. They were overwhelmed by
a snowstorm, and not discovered for three days;
the woman was found to be dead; but the dog,
which was lying by her side, was alive. The
honest creature, however, had not touched the
eatables in his mistress’s basket, but, as neighbouring
villagers remembered when too late, had
been endeavouring, on the evening of the storm,
by whinings and sighs they could not comprehend,
to induce them to follow it to where its
mistress was.</p>

<p>In his <i>Anecdotes of Dogs</i>, Captain Brown speaks
of a mastiff that was locked up by mistake an
entire day in a pantry where milk, butter, and
meat were within reach. The hungry dog did
not touch any of these things, although it ate
voraciously as soon as food was given to it.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton Smith is our authority for
the anecdote of a dog that followed its owner,
who was on horseback, and who contrived to
drop some cakes from his basket as he cantered
home. On his arrival, he found that his trusty
follower had gathered up some of the lost cakes
and carried them home and had gone for the
remainder, which it duly returned with untasted.</p>

<p>‘Dogs,’ says Colonel Smith, ‘have an instinctive
comprehension of the nature of property;’ and
it is really most remarkable, considering that
they have not human speech, how frequently,
and how well, they make us understand their
views on this point. The colonel alludes to the
case of a lady at Bath who was somewhat alarmed
by the behaviour of a strange mastiff that seemed
anxious to prevent her going on. Finding she
had lost her veil, she turned back, the dog going
before her until she came to the missing article
and picked it up. As soon as the dog saw she
had regained her property, it scampered off to
its master.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of this character are innumerable,
as are also those of dogs reclaiming property
belonging, or which has belonged, to their owners.
Sir Patrick Walker furnishes a most valuable
instance of this propensity in our canine cousins.
A farmer having sold a flock of sheep to a dealer,
lent him his dog to drive them home, a distance
of thirty miles, desiring him to give the dog a
meal at the journey’s end and tell it to go
home. The drover found the dog so useful, that
he resolved to steal it, and instead of sending it
back, locked it up. The collie grew sulky, and
at last effected its escape. Evidently deeming the
drover had no more right to detain the sheep
than he had to detain itself, the honest creature
went into the field, collected all the sheep that
had belonged to its master, and, to that person’s
intense astonishment, drove the whole flock home
again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_824">{824}</span></p>

<p>Dogs are not only honest in themselves, but
will not permit others to be dishonest. The late
Grantley Berkeley was wont to tell of his two
deerhounds ‘Smoker’ and Smoker’s son ‘Shark,’
a curiously suggestive instance of parental discipline.
The two dogs were left alone in a room
where luncheon was laid out. Smoker’s integrity
was invincible; but his son had not yet learned
to resist temptation. Through the window, Mr
Berkeley noticed Shark, anxiously watched by
its father, steal a cold tongue and drag it to the
floor. ‘No sooner had he done so,’ says his
master, ‘than the offended sire rushed upon him,
rolled over him, beat him, and took away the
tongue;’ after which Smoker retired gravely to
the fireside.</p>

<p>Mr Blaine, among many similar records, tells
of a spaniel he had which protected the dinner-table,
during its master’s absence, from the
attempts of a cat which sought to make too
intimate an acquaintance with the leg of mutton.
Both the animals belonged to Mr Blaine, and
were on friendly terms with each other; but one
was honest, and the other was not.</p>

<p>Hitherto, specimens of canine integrity have
alone been cited; but it must not be supposed
that dogs are the only animals which exhibit
honest traits. Captain Gordon Stables, in his
book on <i>Cats</i>, proves by several tales of real life
that pussy is often as trustworthy as any dog.
His own cat ‘Muffie’ is allowed her place on
the table at meals, and never attempts to touch
the viands, even when left alone, nor, what is
more suggestive, never allows any one else to
touch them. The present writer’s family had a
white cat which for nearly twenty years was
trusted with anything, until one luckless day, in
its old age, its appetite overcame its reason; it
broke the eighth commandment, and stole a piece
of steak. The distress and shamefacedness of the
poor animal after the crime were quite pathetic;
she hid herself in dark corners; turned her back
on observers, and for several days was so ashamed
of herself, that she could not look any one in the
face, although, poor old favourite, not a person
reproached her for her first known offence against
the laws of property.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than two years ago we had the pleasure
of noticing, with favourable comment, a new book,
<i>Bits from Blinkbonny</i>, by ‘John Strathesk.’ It
was a clever and entertaining book, presenting
successive pictures of Scottish village life drawn
with so much truth and character as at once to
stamp them genuine portraitures.</p>

<p>The author, encouraged no doubt by the well-merited
success of the above volume, has issued
a second, entitled <i>More Bits from Blinkbonny</i>
(Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson, and Ferrier).
‘Continuations’ are proverbially risky, and we
fear we cannot congratulate the author on having
escaped the risk unscathed. The title will perhaps
help the book temporarily&mdash;from a publisher’s
point of view; but it would have fared
better in the long-run had it been issued as an
independent work on village life in Scotland,
leaving the former volume to stand by itself. As
it is, however, it is only when compared with
its predecessor that this volume may be said to
indicate any falling-off on the part of the author.
It is full of bright and truthful sketches of the
habits of life and modes of thought prevalent in
the Scottish Lowlands, and can scarcely fail to
be read with interest by those to whom such
sketches appeal. Here is a story told by a barber
regarding one of his customers. The customer
referred to was a man who got his hair cut only
twice a year, and when he came for this purpose
it was always completely matted. The barber
recommended him to ‘redd’ (that is, comb) his
hair every day. ‘No very likely,’ was the reply;
‘it’s only redd every six months, and then it’s
like to rive a’ the hair out o’ my head; if I
was reddin’t every day, I wadna hae a hair left
at the month’s end.’</p>

<p>The volume, we may add, is tastefully printed
and bound, while the pictorial illustrations give
force to its local characterisations.</p>

<p>In <i>Photography for Amateurs</i> (London: Cassell &amp;
Co.), Mr T. C. Hepworth, lecturer to the late
Polytechnic Institution, gives excellent hints and
instructions for beginners in this art. For those
who have taken up photography as a pleasant
occupation of their leisure hours, this book can
be especially recommended. Most travellers in
Central Africa, or in any little known part of
our world, now find the photographic camera a
necessary adjunct of their equipment, as, by its aid,
rapid and correct pictures can be made of striking
and picturesque scenes. This is equally true of a
pedestrian at home, and Mr Hepworth looks back
with delight to a walking tour in the Highlands,
when he found so many lovely little nooks in the
Trosachs and elsewhere admirably suited to his
art. The effective delineation of objects by
photography demands both care and experience;
but there are now many amateurs of both sexes
who can turn out very satisfactory pictures.
Landscape photography is one thing, and portraiture
is another and more difficult undertaking,
for the inexperienced; but with the help
of such a manual as this, which describes
the necessary apparatus, negative-printing, fixing
and washing the prints, &amp;c., the way must be
greatly smoothed for beginners in the art. The
Introduction presents a concise history of the
art up to the time when the use of gelatine
dry plates made the practice of photography
more convenient and possible for amateurs.</p>

<p>Lately we noticed in these pages the publication
of a volume of music entitled <i>The Athole
Collection of Dance Music of Scotland</i>, edited by
Mr James Stewart Robertson (Edradynate). To
this we have now to add by the same publishers,
<i>The Killin Collection of Gaelic Songs</i>, with
music and translations, by Mr Charles Stewart
(Edinburgh, Maclachlan and Stewart). In selecting
and arranging the melodies in this collection,
the editor has borne in mind (1) Those that have
already established themselves as favourites; (2)
Those that have not been published until now,
but which, in his opinion, are deserving of publication;
(3) Some ancient chants to which the
Fingalic poetry was sung; and (4) A few hymn
tunes&mdash;one of them old, and the others on the
lines of old Gaelic melody, in the hope of showing
how admirably that melody is fitted for sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_825">{825}</span>
song. Mr Stewart has been assisted by Mr
Merryleas in arranging the harmonies and accompaniments;
and in the supplying of English
words for the Gaelic originals he has had the
efficient help of such well-known pens as those
of Principal Shairp, Professor Blackie, Dr Norman
Macleod, and others. This collection of Gaelic
music ought to have a hearty reception, not
only from those who are familiar with Celtic
surroundings, but also from students of music
generally, as an important contribution to the
history and archæology of the art.</p>

<p class="center">⁂</p>

<p>The International Forestry Exhibition of 1884
gave a new impetus to the study of forestry. The
importance of that science is now coming to be
generally recognised, and private individuals, as
well as those mysterious beings ‘the authorities,’
are bestowing some attention upon the practical
application of its principles. Dr J. C. Brown
has, more than any other living writer, identified
himself with this important subject, and it is
worthy of notice that all the works which have
been produced by his prolific pen during the last
few years are remarkable for their wide learning,
profound and practical acquaintance with the
science as practised all over the world, and happy
style of expression. His <i>Introduction to the Study
of Modern Forest Economy</i> (Edinburgh: Oliver
&amp; Boyd) is no exception to this rule. Within
very moderate limits, he has contrived to convey
much information relative to the present state
of forest-science.</p>

<p>The facts relating to the time when the greater
part of Europe was covered with forests are of
great interest, and also the account here given
of the consequences of their disappearance. And
it may be observed that in addition to such
generally admitted evils as the scarcity of timber
and droughts&mdash;as to the latter of which Dr Brown
gives us many graphic illustrations, collected
during his residence at the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;it
is alleged that many of those devastating inundations
which occur with such alarming frequency
in some countries are due to this cause.
It is certainly worthy of notice that floods seldom
originate in densely wooded lands, and have been
largely prevented in France by artificial <i>reboisement</i>;
while in Northern Germany, the same
process has been very successfully followed in
fixing down and utilising drift-sand.</p>

<p class="center">⁂</p>

<p>To judge by the examples of stuffed pets which
are to be seen in many private houses, there certainly
seems to be room for a handbook on the
art of stuffing fish, flesh, and fowl. This has
at anyrate been supplied in <i>Practical Taxidermy</i>,
by Montague Brown, F.Z.S. (London: L. Upcott
Gill). As a ‘manual of instruction to the amateur
in collecting, preserving, and setting up natural
history specimens of all kinds,’ the volume leaves
little to be desired. Not only has Mr Brown
betrayed many of the secrets with which professional
taxidermists have sought to surround
their art, but he has particularised with minuteness
and patience the whole <i>technique</i> of skinning
and preserving birds, mammals, fishes, and reptiles.
Moreover, his book justifies its title, for it
is above all things practical. Besides being a
guide to the taxidermist’s art, the book gives a
chapter on ‘dressing and softening skins and furs
as leather.’</p>

<p class="center">⁂</p>

<p>The study of the diseases of plants offers a
very wide field to the inquirer, and it is only
of recent years that investigations in this direction
have come to be regarded as of economic
importance. In spite of the strong prejudices of
agriculturists of the old school, it is believed
that vegetable pathology will prove to be of the
greatest practical value, and that the time is
approaching when the best means of preventing
the attacks of disease will be a recognised branch
of practical agriculture. This eventuality is certainly
indicated by the appearance of <i>Diseases of
Field and Garden Crops, chiefly such as are caused
by Fungi</i>, by Worthington G. Smith (London:
Macmillan &amp; Co.). Originally delivered as addresses
at the request of the officers of the Institute
of Agriculture at the British Museum, South
Kensington, these notes are very full and elaborate,
while the admirable illustrations with which
they are accompanied give them an additional
value. Although necessarily technical, the definition
of all the phenomena of the diseases has been
given in familiar words, and all botanical terms
have been explained. To illustrate the thoroughness
with which the work has been done, having
regard to the limits of the volume, we find under
‘Potatoes’ the new disease (<i>Peziza postuma</i>) which
has made its appearance within the last few years,
the dreaded disease produced by the parasitic
fungus of the murrain, the smut, scab, and the
old potato disease in its active and passive state.
Then mildew and blight are treated of as affecting
respectively onions, straw, turnips, cabbages,
grass, corn, borage, barberries, parsnips, peas, and
lettuces. There are also valuable notes upon the
new diseases which are making such havoc with
grass, wheat, barley, ryegrass, and onions; and
their fungoid character is conclusively established.
The book, like those on cognate subjects by Miss
Ormerod, which have been already noticed in
these pages, will amply repay careful study.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MONTH">THE MONTH:
<br />
SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Society of Arts, London, has just commenced
the one hundred and thirty-first session
of its useful career. Professor Abel, the chairman
of its Council, presided at the opening meeting,
and his speech was a resumé of the progress of
scientific research in various directions, in which
a large number of persons are just now much
interested. Being an electrician, he naturally
devoted some time to the progress of electrical
illumination, and pointed to the wonderful display
at the recent International Health Exhibition
as an illustration of the grand results now
possible. He also expressed himself satisfied with
the recent advances made in the direction of
electric railways and other means of locomotion
to which the comparatively new power has been
experimentally applied, not omitting a very
favourable reference to the telpherage system of
Professor Fleeming Jenkin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_826">{826}</span></p>

<p>The present position of the science of aërial
navigation does not commend itself to Professor
Abel as holding out much hope of future success.
The recent experiments in France, during which
an electrically propelled balloon was made to
take more than one short excursion in a predetermined
direction, merely prove that electricity
can, under exceptionally favourable circumstances,
be employed in this new service. But much
has been done in making balloons serviceable for
purposes of reconnaissance in warfare, the various
details, such as making and transporting hydrogen
gas in a compressed state to the field of action,
having been successfully provided for.</p>

<p>Attention was also called in Professor Abel’s
address to compressed carbonic acid gas as a
convenient source of power. Messrs Krupp, the
great cannon-founders, at their extensive works
at Essen are using this power for maintaining steel
castings under pressure during the solidification of
the metal. The earthen mould is closed directly
it is filled with metal, after which the compressed
gas is admitted to it from a reservoir of liquid
carbonic acid, and in this way the space above
the molten metal is filled with gas under very
high pressure. A tendency to the formation of
flaws and cavities, which nearly all metals are
subject to&mdash;meaning, in the case of railway plant,
broken bridges and fractured crank axles&mdash;is in
this way completely avoided. It is believed that
the employment of this gas under pressure&mdash;compressed,
that is, to the liquid state and stored
in iron bottles&mdash;has a very wide future before
it in many other useful applications.</p>

<p>Lastly, the important question of a pure water-supply
engaged the professor’s attention, and his
opinion on this point will be best given in his
own words. ‘I venture,’ he says, ‘to think that
our hope for a radical improvement in the water-supply
of this great metropolis lies rather in the
application of a simple, expeditious, cheap, and
effective mode of chemical treatment to supplies
from sources now in use, previous to their filtration,
than in a complete change of our source of
supply.’ It now, therefore, remains for future
experimenters to devise some means by which
water can be freed from those germs which, under
various names, are now said to be responsible for
the ills of mankind, and at the same time be left
uncontaminated by any foreign matter. The problem
seems to be a hard one to solve, but not
harder than many which have been successfully
conquered by modern science.</p>

<p>Whilst our never-ending difficulties in the
Soudan and South Africa are giving us costly
information regarding those parts of the huge
continent, Mr Joseph Thomson comes back from
his hazardous journey in Eastern Africa to tell us
about a tract of country with regard to which
hardly anything before was known. If we refer
to a map of Africa, we shall be readily able to
note the position of Lake Victoria Nyanza, with
which Mr H. M. Stanley’s name is identified.
Between this lake and the coast lies the theatre
of Mr Thomson’s wanderings. With an inadequate
number of followers, the great majority of
whom he describes as the very offscourings of
Zanzibar villainy, this intrepid explorer prosecuted
his work in the face of almost inconceivable
perils. His contributions to geographical
knowledge are of great importance, and his sole
reward is the hearty reception accorded to him
the other evening, when he gave a graphic
account of his adventures to the Royal Geographical
Society.</p>

<p>At the recent Exhibition at Philadelphia, attention
was directed in a rather comical but effective
manner to the Edison electric lamp. A powerful
lamp of this description was fastened to the head
of a black man, concealed wires being carried
down his body from it and connected with copper
discs on the heels of his boots. This coloured
gentleman&mdash;the term ‘darkie’ is here obviously
inadmissible&mdash;could become luminous at will by
simply placing his heels upon certain copper
conductors laid along the floor, which were in
circuit with the general system for lighting the
building.</p>

<p>A still more startling novelty in electric illumination
was organised in New York a few weeks
ago, an illustration of which is given in the <i>Scientific
American</i>, published in that city. This consisted
of an electric torchlight procession, which
traversed several of the streets; and its object was,
we presume, to advertise the Edison system of
electric illumination. The procession may be best
described as a hollow square formed by about
three hundred men, each wearing a helmet, surmounted
by a powerful electric lamp, and each
holding the protected rope which carried the current
from one to the other. In the centre of the
square travelled a steam-engine and dynamo-machine&mdash;on
trucks drawn by horses&mdash;followed by
coal and water carts to supply the engine with
its necessary food. Both horses and trucks were
decorated with lamps, and the leader of the brilliant
throng carried a staff tipped with radiance
of two hundred candle-power.</p>

<p>Our readers will learn with interest that Mr
Clement Wragge, the pioneer of the meteorological
station on the summit of Ben Nevis, is
initiating a work of similar character in Australia.
He has placed self-registering instruments on the
top of Mount Lofty in connection with the
Observatory at Sydney, and has appealed to the
public to help in promoting scientific research by
leaving them untouched.</p>

<p>An explosion last July at a gunpowder factory
in Lancashire, by which four men lost their lives,
was caused by lightning. This disaster once more
calls attention to the grave necessity which exists
for buildings, and such buildings especially, to
be protected by efficient lightning-conductors.
From Colonel Ford’s Report upon the matter,
which as Inspector of Explosives he has just
presented to the Secretary of State, it appears
that a conductor was fitted to the doomed building,
but that it was a defective one. He states
that there is no authentic case on record where
a properly constructed lightning-conductor failed
to do its duty; and recommends that these
safeguards should be periodically examined and
tested.</p>

<p>From time to time, we have given in these
pages the results of different experiments with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_827">{827}</span>
the new method of preserving fodder, known as
ensilage, and have expressed the hope that our
farmers may find in it some compensation for
recent bad times. We now learn from the
agricultural returns for 1884 how widespread
have been the experiments in this direction.
These returns state that no fewer than six hundred
and ten silos have been built in this country,
of which five hundred and fourteen are to be
found in England, sixty in Scotland, and thirty-six
in Wales. Of the English counties, Norfolk
heads the list with fifty-nine silos. In
Scotland, Argyll has twelve, and is followed
by Lanark and Renfrew, which counties have
each half that number. The largest silo noted
in the returns is in the county of Argyll. We
may gather from these figures that the principle
of ensilage as adapted to British farming has
now entirely passed the experimental stage. (This
important subject is further noticed in one of our
Occasional Notes. See <a href="#Page_829">p. 829</a>.)</p>

<p>The novel proposal has lately been made by
Mr W. O. Chambers, the Secretary of the National
Fish-culture Association, that fishponds should
be established on lands which are unavailable for
ordinary crops, and that unprofitable agri-culture
should give place to profitable aqua-culture. The
fish which it is said can be made to accomplish
this desirable result is the carp, and the German
carp in particular. According to Mr Chambers,
this fish attains in three years a weight of four
pounds, and its fecundity is so great that it
will yield an average of half a million eggs.
He states that one acre of water will produce,
with little or no expense for food or maintenance,
five thousand fish per annum. In a word, we
are recommended to do as did the monks of old
when monastic buildings were dotted over the
land. The remains of fish stews or ponds left
to us by the monks can be pointed to in plenty,
and the question arises, if fresh-water fish-culture
is really so profitable, why were these
ponds suffered to fall into disuse? Another consideration
arises as to whether, supposing the
scheme to be possible, modern taste, not compelled
to eat fish on certain days, would find the
fresh-water variety palatable?</p>

<p>The British Rainfall Association is one of those
unobtrusive societies which is doing quietly a
work of great good. Begun some years back
by Mr Symons, who set up a rain-gauge in his
garden in London, and put himself in communication
with a few friends in other parts of the
country who did the same, the Association now
numbers two thousand observers, spread over
the United Kingdom. Mr Symons has lately
published a curious diagram showing approximately
the amount of rain which has fallen each
year in Britain for two centuries. Of course
such a record cannot pretend to be infallible,
especially in the case of the earlier period which
it covers, but it opens out more than one extremely
interesting subject for inquiry.</p>

<p>The year 1884, with its genial spring, its
splendid summer, and its gorgeous autumn, has
been one in which the rainfall has been somewhat
below the average; and in some districts
there have been positive symptoms of a water-famine.
But if we look back to the last century,
we find a period of drought between the years
1738 and 1750, which, if it recurred in the present
day would, in Mr Symons’s opinion, dry up
the water-supply of nearly every town in the
kingdom. Another curious observation is this:
an unusually wet year seems to occur at intervals
of ten years, the years ending with the figure
four being the favoured ones. Thus, 1854, ’64,
’74, and so on, were wet years. But at the same
time another twelve-year cycle of dry years also
occurs&mdash;the years 1824, ’36, ’48, and so on, having
been particularly limited in their rainfall. In
this year of grace 1884, the two cycles terminate
together, as they must do every now and then.
So we have a year of doubt, and know not
until its close which influence has proved the
stronger.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rapid advance that has
been made during the past few years in the beautiful
art of photography, and the various new
applications of it in different arts and sciences,
in one particular it has stood still. A negative
picture upon glass can, as every one knows, be
produced in a fraction of a second. But the after-process
of producing so-called positive prints on
paper from that negative is a tedious business,
depending in great measure upon the brilliancy
of the weather. Messrs Marion of London have
endeavoured to obviate these inconveniences by
the manufacture of a special kind of paper, the
nature of which they at present keep secret, and
which they now offer to the photographic world.
By this paper a negative can be made to yield a
positive image in a few seconds, quite independently
of daylight, for a gas jet or paraffin lamp is
sufficient to affect its extreme sensitiveness. This
invention will enable a photographer to send his
patron a dozen or more copies of a portrait that
has been taken the same day.</p>

<p>The Bread Reform League is a useful society
which has been formed to counteract the modern
tendency to make what is properly called ‘the
staff of life’ in such a way that many of its
most useful ingredients are discarded. This
society has, under the organisation of its energetic
honorary secretary, Miss Yates, opened an Exhibition
in London, where different samples of
bread stuffs, treated in various ways, are shown.
The profits of this Exhibition are to go to a
‘Penny Dinner and Breakfast Fund’ for the
benefit of needy children attending the Board
Schools. Hitherto, only food for the mind has
been provided at these establishments, and the
fact has recently leaked out that forty per
cent. of the children arrive at some of them
without any breakfast, and that at other schools
twenty-eight per cent. often are dinnerless. It
is a terribly sad story, and one very difficult to
reconcile with the oft repeated boast that London
is the richest city in the world.</p>

<p>The <i>Graphic</i> makes a very sensible suggestion
with reference to those gloomy places called
railway waiting-rooms. In similar places in
France, the walls are often adorned with well-executed
maps in relief, showing the country
through which the line passes. Why should
not this system be adopted in Britain? Constant
travellers know to their cost that there are many
railway stations in the kingdom where waiting-rooms
are only too necessary. The cry of ‘All
change here!’ often means that all will be
compelled to wait here for an indefinite period.
Now, if waiting-rooms were furnished with maps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_828">{828}</span>
and framed notices giving some account of the
history of the surrounding neighbourhood, its
antiquities, natural beauties, &amp;c., the dreary time
might in many cases be turned into a pleasant
visit, and would most infallibly do good as an
advertisement to the railway itself.</p>

<p>At a recent sale of art treasures at Cologne,
there were put up to auction two curiosities
which had been bought by their late possessor
at some obscure town in Switzerland twenty-four
years ago for the sum of twenty-three francs.
One was a fifteenth-century cup of Venetian glass,
and the other was a bundle of tapestry. At the
last sale, these articles formed two distinct lots,
and they realised more than thirty-six thousand
francs&mdash;that is, fifteen hundred pounds sterling.</p>

<p>The question of ‘musical pitch’ has for many
years troubled musicians, each country adopting
a note giving a different number of vibrations per
second as its standard. In Britain, we have the
Philharmonic pitch, and when any one talks of
having his piano tuned up to concert pitch, the
Philharmonic standard is the one indicated. For
some reason, the modern pitch is made higher
than that recognised in past days, and consequently
the compositions of some of the best
composers are now heard in a key higher than
that intended by their authors. We understand
that a conference upon the subject is shortly to
be organised. In the meantime, the Italian War
Minister has sought the opinions of living composers
with reference to the best pitch for military
bands. We need only refer to the reply of one
of these, Verdi, whose name is as familiar in
Britain as in the country of his birth. He writes
in reference to the modern high pitch: ‘The
lowering of the diapason will by no means impair
the sonorousness and brilliancy of execution;
it will, on the contrary, give something noble,
full, majestic to the tone, which the strident
effects of the higher pitch do not possess.’ He
goes on to say that one pitch should be common
to all nations. ‘The musical language is universal;
why, therefore, should the note which is
called A in Paris or Milan become B♭ in Rome?’</p>

<p>A German paper gives some interesting statistics
relative to ear disease, which have been collected
from different aural surgeons. From these, we
gather that males are more subject to ear disease
than females. Out of every three middle-aged
persons, there is found one who does not hear
so well with one ear as with the other. The
liability to disease increases from birth to the
age of forty, after which it decreases as old age
is reached. Of six thousand children examined,
twenty-three per cent. show symptoms of ear
disease, and thirty-two per cent. a deficiency of
hearing power. With regard to the results of
surgical treatment, we learn that of the total
number of cases of all kinds, fifty-three per cent.
are cured, and thirty per cent. are benefited. We
fancy that these figures are rather more favourable
than surgeons in this country can show, it
being well known that aural cases are among the
most uncertain and unsatisfactory to deal with.</p>

<p>The steamship <i>Ionic</i>, which lately left this
country for New Zealand, took out with her a
large number of passengers of a description not
usually met with on shipboard. They consisted
of one hundred and fifty-eight stoats and weasels,
whose mission in New Zealand will be to prey
upon the rabbits which are fast overrunning that
country. This is the third consignment which
has left our shores. The little animals are
accommodated in zinc-lined boxes, and during the
forty days’ journey are calculated to require for
their food more than two thousand live pigeons,
which accompany them. The poor pigeons also
require food, and therefore sixteen quarters of
Indian corn were taken out for their consumption.
Altogether, the expense to the colonial government
must be something considerable, but will
not be grudged if the required result is achieved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STOCK_EXCHANGE_MORALITY">STOCK EXCHANGE MORALITY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> there are few institutions possessing
attributes more diametrically opposed to one
another than the Stock Exchange. Undoubtedly
useful in its way, it nevertheless abounds in gross
abuse. It is a necessity to the <i>bonâ fide</i> investor,
as indicating the locality where he can on the
instant purchase or find a market for almost
any stock in the world; yet it becomes a very
hotbed of vice in the hands of the professional
speculator. We apply this term to the man
who fraudulently buys without the intention of
paying, and worse still, sells what he does not
possess. The method of so doing was fully
explained in an article on ‘Corners’ in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/65598/65598-h/65598-h.htm#CORNERS">No. 19</a> of
this <i>Journal</i>. Take a quite recent illustration of
the two evils. Only a short time ago, a letter
purporting to come from Mr Gladstone’s private
secretary, addressed to the Secretary of the
Exchange, was received by him, and posted up
in the House. It stated that certain unexpected
interests would be paid to the Peruvian bondholders.
The price went up over thirty per
cent. in a few moments, so that any one having
bought ten thousand pounds-worth the day
before, could have then sold them for nearly
fourteen thousand pounds. It is more than
probable that the writer of the forged letter had
previously purchased without any intention of
paying or ‘taking them off,’ and on the imposition
taking effect, at once sold out not only
those he possessed, but also more that he did
not possess. Within half an hour, the forgery
was discovered, when the price immediately fell
the thirty per cent. it had just risen. Thus this
impudent adventurer would not only secure an
enormous profit by the rise, but by buying back
on the fall the extra quantity he had sold on the
rise, reap an additional profit.</p>

<p>Now, it is this class of gambling, particularly
the selling of what one does not possess, for the
purpose of depressing the value of a certain stock
to the prejudice of real holders, that constitutes
the most unwholesome element of our Stock
Exchange. Every conceivable artifice, the most
consummate cunning, the most unblushing lies,
are employed to depreciate a security which has
either risen to a high figure on its merits, or
else been puffed up artificially beforehand. Syndicates,
as they are called&mdash;combinations of unprincipled
men usually&mdash;are formed for the
purpose, and there are indeed very few stocks
existing at the present day that are not honoured
by their especial syndicate. On any unfavourable
rumour, more often concocted than otherwise,
these eagle-eyed monsters swoop down
upon their unsuspecting and inoffensive prey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_829">{829}</span>
attacking with the ferociousness of a bear, until,
in sheer desperation, one victim after another
succumbs, and sells out to the ‘bear’ at an
enormous sacrifice, in order to save the remnant
of his dwindled inheritance. If, as they were
uttered in it, the falsehoods of a single day could
but glue themselves to and stick on the walls
of that building, it would be a feat impossible
of achievement for a fly to crawl unscathed
between them! Monte Carlo is bad; but an
institution where more fortunes are dishonestly
lost and won in a day than at that notorious
gambling-place in a week, must be at least no
better, if not infinitely worse.</p>

<p>That there are men of integrity on ’Change,
men of known principle, gentlemen in every sense
of the word, admits of no doubt; and it is they
who would first appreciate any effort, legislative
or otherwise, for the suppression of the practices
alluded to here. An act called ‘Leeman’s Act’
was passed some years ago for the special protection
of shareholders in banking establishments,
which made it illegal to sell shares of any bank
without first proving yourself to be a <i>bonâ fide</i>
holder of its shares, giving their respective numbers,
&amp;c. The same protection should be afforded
to every shareholder, no matter of what stock;
and the time has now arrived for the legislature
to take the matter seriously in hand. The blessings
conferred thereby would be inestimable.</p>

<h3>MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LIGHTNING STROKES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the first monthly meeting for the session of
the Royal Meteorological Society, a paper was
read by Colonel the Honourable Arthur Parnell
on ‘The Mechanical Characteristics of Lightning
Strokes.’ The main objects of this paper were&mdash;first,
to attempt to show that lightning is not a
sort of electric fluid that descends from the clouds,
injures buildings and persons in its course, and
dissipates itself in the earth; but that it is a
luminous manifestation of the explosion, caused
by two equal forces springing towards each other
simultaneously from the earth and the under
surface of the inducing cloud, and coalescing or
flying out nearly midway between the two plates
of the electrical condenser formed by the earth
and the cloud; secondly, to demonstrate that of
these two forces, it is the earth-spring or upward
force alone that injures buildings, persons, or
other objects on the earth’s surface, and that
constitutes tangibly what is rightly known as a
lightning stroke. The author gave the details
of two hundred and seventy-eight instances, the
records of which were intended to demonstrate
with more or less precision the existence of an
upward direction in the force of the stroke. The
theory of the descent of the electric fluid was suggested
a few years ago by M. Colladon, a French
Professor, and a notice of it will be found in
<i>Chambers’s Journal</i> for October 16, 1880.</p>


<h3>PERSONS KILLED BY WILD ANIMALS IN INDIA.</h3>

<p>A return published in the governmental <i>Gazette</i>
shows that the number of persons killed by wild
animals and snakes in 1883 was 22,905, as against
22,125 in the previous year. Of these, 20,067
deaths were due to snake-bites, 985 to tigers,
and 504 to other carnivora. The loss of cattle
from the same cause amounted to 47,478 animals,
being an increase of 771 on the figures for
the previous year. It is somewhat remarkable
that while the great majority of human deaths
is set down to snakes, only 1644 cattle are said
to have perished from that cause. Nearly three-fourths
of the deaths occurred in Bengal and the
North-west Provinces. The number of dangerous
animals killed during the year was 19,890, and
more than fifteen thousand pounds was paid in
rewards. In regard to the fearful mortality from
snake-bites, it might be suggested that the government
should increase the rewards paid for bringing
in the dead bodies of these reptiles, or otherwise
take more active measures for their destruction.</p>


<h3>ENSILAGE.</h3>

<p>Mr Edward S. Blunt, Blaby Hill, Leicester,
writing to the newspapers on the subject of
Ensilage, says that he has recently opened two
of his silos, and both have proved very satisfactory.
He adds:</p>

<p>‘Two years since I tried pits sunk in the
ground without any building; last year I tried
bricks cemented on the inside; this year I have
tried wood, and am so pleased with the result
that I certainly shall stick to it for the future.
Notwithstanding its perishable nature, I believe
it will compare most favourably as regards
expense with anything else. I have used one-inch
red deal boards, grooved and tongued, and
these I find quite sufficient to resist what little
lateral pressure there is. I have built my silos,
four in number, partly in the ground and partly
out. This may be considered merely as a matter
of convenience, as I find the ensilage just as good
in one part as in the other. I construct them
in such a manner that they are easily put up
and taken down again; thus at a very trifling
cost they can be removed from one place to
another. My first silo, a round one, only six
feet in diameter, was filled in May with rough
grass cut from the hedge-sides and from under
some trees; neither cattle nor horses would eat
this before it went into the silo, but both will
eat it readily enough now that it is made into
ensilage. My second silo, only eight feet in
diameter, was first filled with pea-straw after
the main crop had been gathered for market,
and then refilled with the second cutting of
clover; this is all very good quite up to the
boards at the sides.</p>

<p>‘I am weighting my silos this year with a
press I have invented and patented. I obtain
my weight by means of levers: two levers, each
twenty feet long, with four hundredweight at the
end, will give eight tons weight upon the silo,
and being thoroughly continuous in its action,
I am able to dispense with the labour and cost
of moving so large a quantity of dead-weight.’
There is to be a model of the silo and press
exhibited at the Smithfield Show, Islington.</p>

<p>Mr Blunt further explains his method of filling
the silo. He says: ‘In nearly every instance I
placed the grass or clover in the silo the day
after it was cut, and as it was put in, it was well
trampled. In three or four days the silage sank
from twelve feet to eight, and as it sank I put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_830">{830}</span>
in more. In about ten days from the time when
the silo was first filled I put on the weight.
The silage at this time had attained a temperature
of from one hundred and forty to one hundred
and fifty degrees. After the weight was applied,
the temperature never rose any higher; but, at
the end of a fortnight, had fallen to one hundred
and thirty degrees, and then continued to fall.
When the silage had sunk sufficiently low in the
silo, I took off the weights and boards and filled
up to the top again; this I repeated three or
four times.’</p>


<h3>A HANDY GAS COOKING-STOVE.</h3>

<p>To his already extensive list of gas cooking
apparatus, Mr Fletcher, Warrington, has just added
what he calls his ‘Large Cottage Cooker,’ which
is simply a Gas cooking-stove in the cheapest and
simplest form to be effective. For two pounds
may be had a good roasting, and a fairly good
pastry and bread oven, with a reversible boiler
and grillers on the top. The body of the stove
is made of galvanised iron, and the shelves are
wrought iron. The height of the whole is thirty
inches; space inside the oven twelve by twelve by
sixteen inches.</p>

<p>When we consider their convenience to housekeepers
and the time which they save, we do
not wonder that the use of such stoves is rapidly
extending. The equable nature of the heat insures
good cookery; a pot or kettle may be boiled on
the burner in a few minutes, and the housewife
may be kept quite easy as to the state of her
kitchen fire for cooking purposes. In fact, in
summer the kitchen fire may be dispensed with
altogether. There is no smoke or ashes; pans
and kettles are easier kept clean, and all this is
done at but a trifling expense for gas&mdash;say one
penny per hour for a medium stove. A potato
steamer will be found a useful adjunct to the
stove. By its aid, the potatoes, after being boiled,
are finished off with steam in the upper part of the
same vessel; and will be found drier and mealier
than if cooked in an ordinary pot in the old way.</p>


<h3>RAILWAY PASSENGERS.</h3>

<p>A curious return has just been issued, showing
the number of railway passengers who have
travelled on all the railways in the United
Kingdom during the half-year ending 30th June
last, by which it will be seen that railway shareholders
continue to be mainly indebted for their
dividends to third-class traffic. During the above
period the number of passengers who travelled
were as follows, omitting fractions: First class,
sixteen million one hundred thousand; second
class, twenty-five million eight hundred thousand;
third class, two hundred and forty-one
million seven hundred thousand&mdash;the number
of third-class passengers being more than five
hundred per cent. in excess of first and second
class combined; and the relative amount of
receipts is in equal proportion. This remarkable
difference applies to all the lines in common,
the third-class passengers being in excess all
throughout the kingdom. But the North London
line is especially striking in regard to receipts,
inasmuch as the receipts from the third-class
passengers amounted to about eight hundred
per cent. more than from the first and second
combined! Within the same period, the Metropolitan
and District Railways, and the North
London Railway, carried over fifty million passengers;
to which enormous return must be
added, as showing the prodigious traffic within
the area of the metropolis, that of the Great
Eastern; London, Chatham, and Dover; London
and Brighton; South-western; and South-eastern&mdash;a
large portion of whose traffic is purely metropolitan.</p>


<h3>THE NEW ALBO-CARBON LIGHT.</h3>

<p>An experiment has been tried on a grand
scale with this new and beautiful light, which
as an illuminating medium will most certainly
take a front place, whether the question is gas
or electricity. The immense church belonging
to the Oratory of St Philip Neri at Brompton
has lately been illuminated by the employment
of eight twelve-light, two six-light, and two four-light
clusters constructed on this principle; and
these have been found so effective, that the
interior of this vast and very lofty building is
filled with a brilliant, yet soft and subdued,
light, which covers the area of the great church.
The authorities of the Oratory have expressed
their satisfaction at the favourable results of the
experiment; and the capability of the Albo-carbon
Light has been demonstrated as to bringing
out clearly the architectural features of our
churches, which, as a general rule, are not celebrated
for the excellence of their various systems
of gas-lighting. Therefore, any clear and brilliant
light which will do this, and at the same time
not add too much to the heat of the interior,
should be hailed as an inestimable boon, and
be one of the chief recommendations of this new
and beautiful system.</p>


<h3>THE LAST OF OLD SION COLLEGE.</h3>

<p>One by one the old City landmarks are disappearing
before the ruthless hand of the modern
speculative builder. Many of the City churches
have already been taken down and their sites
covered with shops or warehouses; Charter House
and St Paul’s School are both going; and Sion
College is gone&mdash;to be opened in a new building
on the Thames Embankment, into which the
ancient stone front is to be transferred from
London Wall. The College, of which all the
City vicars and rectors are Fellows, was originally
incorporated in 1630, but burnt down in
the great fire of London, to be rebuilt shortly
afterwards. The site is let for building, but
the ancient wooden fittings of the Hall and
Library have been sold. The fine library of
books will be removed to the new building when
complete.</p>


<h3>IRISH FEMALE EMIGRATION.</h3>

<p>Mr Vere Foster, of Belfast, has issued another
appeal on behalf of his Irish Female Emigration
Fund, which has already been the means of
granting assisted passages to twenty thousand two
hundred and fifty girls from the west of Ireland
to the United States and colonies, at an expenditure
of about thirty thousand pounds. This
scheme has the support&mdash;as it should have&mdash;of the
clergy of all denominations, and there is little
doubt that if carefully gone about, it will prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_831">{831}</span>
a benefit both to Ireland and the colonies. Mr
Foster, who has exhausted what he can spare of
his own means and the funds placed at his disposal,
has also given assistance by loan to four
hundred girls, who have promised to repay him.
We trust they may do so, as the good fortune
of four hundred more hangs on this contingency.</p>

<p>The purpose of the fund is the relief of present
poverty in the densely peopled districts of the
west of Ireland, by assisting the emigration of
young women of good character of the farm and
domestic-servant class. To such it gives a chance
of well-doing impossible at home, where, if they
marry and rear families, there is but a prospect of
poverty for themselves and all concerned. The
scheme is a resumption of that adopted with
gratifying results immediately after the great
famine of 1846-7.</p>

<p>The plan which Mr Foster has had in operation
for helping these young women for the past
five years is a very simple one. Blank forms
of application are issued to inquirers, when, if
returned and approved of, vouchers to a certain
value are issued in their favour. These vouchers
are available within three months of issue for
embarkation from Liverpool or from any port
in Ireland where the necessary arrangements have
been made. The promoter of this scheme does
not approve of shipping young girls in large
companies, but leaves them the utmost freedom
in their choice of ship and port and time of
embarkation. This enables them to take a passage
when perhaps they can have the company
of friends and neighbours. The young
women thus assisted were between eighteen and
thirty years of age; and it is satisfactory to know
that most of them are going on well, and that
many of them have sent home money to their
friends more than once.</p>

<p>One of the most satisfactory forms of good
doing is to help people to help themselves. This
is the object of the Irish Female Emigration
Fund.</p>


<h3>EXPLORATION IN THE CHILIAN ARGENTINE ANDES.</h3>

<p>It would appear, from the proceedings of the
Berlin Academy of Sciences, that Dr Güssfeldt’s
explorations in the central Chilian Argentine
Andes extended from November 1882 to March
1883, in the wild and lofty mountain region
containing Aconcagua, the most elevated known
point of the American continent, which lies
between thirty-two and thirty-five degrees south
latitude, and is bounded on the east by the
Argentine Pampas, and on the west by the
Pacific. Much of this journey being through
new country, Dr Güssfeldt daily observed the
great orographical and landscape features, the
glacial conditions above the snow, the character
of the vegetation, and the phenomena of rock-weathering.
He also undertook the special duty
of fixing positions astronomically and taking
altitudes; for which purpose he was provided
with nineteen instruments. The central Chilian
Argentine Andes are sketched by the traveller
as two parallel chains, having on the Pacific
an outlying coast-range. The western chain is
the true water-parting of the Atlantic and Pacific;
and the eastern is in many places broken through
by the waters rising in the great trough between
the two chains, which has no well-defined valley
formation, indications of a longitudinal depression
being only found at intervals, constantly
interrupted by cross ridges. This trough or basin,
one hundred and eighty-five miles in length,
is very difficult of exploration, and only three
months of the year are available for the purpose.
The doctor crossed the divide at four points, and
obtained altitudes from nine thousand four hundred
and ninety-four feet to twenty-two thousand
eight hundred and sixty-seven feet, which was
reached near the great volcano Aconcagua, not far
from the commencement of Valle Hermoso. A
most interesting question of the effect of rarefied air
at great elevations upon the human frame is dwelt
upon by the doctor. He states that he and his
assistant attained twenty-one thousand and thirty
feet on Aconcagua, and were able to work their
scientific instruments at that height, though not
in good condition, through anxiety and want of
sleep. Their lungs were physically exhausted by
the effort of speaking; but there was no flow
of blood from nose or ears. He says that the
so-called <i>puna</i> can be resisted by mental effort
and confidence, the only effect upon a properly
trained individual being increased lung-action,
and that any one who could work as he did at
twenty-one thousand and thirty feet, could reach
the top of Aconcagua, where the proportion of
oxygen is only 6.2-3 per cent. less than at the
former elevation.</p>


<h3>NATIVE TREATMENT OF DISEASES IN INDIA.</h3>

<p>A correspondent thus writes: Regarding the
native treatment of diseases, one of the most
curious things I ever witnessed was a half-clad
native shouting through the streets of a
country town: ‘Does any one want back his
sight?&mdash;one rupee only!’ as if he were hawking
fruits or sweetmeats; and, to my astonishment,
a patient soon presented himself to be operated
on for cataract. There and then standing in the
bazaar, the itinerant oculist took out his penknife
and performed the operation in a few minutes,
bound up the man’s eyes, and telling him to keep
in the dark for a fortnight, received his fee of
one rupee, and shouted his war-cry for more
patients. The operation was almost unvaryingly
successful; one instance among my servants being
a woman of eighty, who had charge of my fowl-house,
and had for many a day been sightless,
except to distinguish light from darkness, and
who in this way was successfully operated upon.
Besides this operator are bone-setters, and medical
rubbers male and female, especially represented
by the hereditary low-caste <i>accoucheuse</i> of each
village, whose skill in shampooing is such an aid
in her lowly calling&mdash;as the natives regard it&mdash;as
to supplant much of the useless medicine and
enforced rest of more civilised countries, and save
endless mischief and suffering to her sex. What
skill they have is of course almost purely traditional.
None of the science of the world or
British usage has yet altered in the slightest
degree either the customs of the native or his
horror at the idea of male physicians for women&mdash;especially
in certain ailments&mdash;and their wonder
at our obtuseness and disregard of propriety on
so delicate a point. To supply a vacancy so
long unfilled, lady-doctors have now appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_832">{832}</span>
on the scene, who, it is hoped by reaching the
zenanas, may reach the real source through which
a higher enlightenment in India is possible. An
immense field is open to them along with every
encouragement; and were but some of the many
young ladies at home who are straining health
for a future pittance in one or other of the spheres
of teaching, to turn their attention in this direction,
they would find an opening of wider and
greater utility before them, and a prospect of large
and rapid emolument.</p>

destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
